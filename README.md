## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2020 election data using supervised learning techniques. The project is structured into several Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a different machine learning algorithm. Our focus was on exploring and optimizing five algorithms: Decision Trees (DT), Boosting, Neural Networks (NN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Data

For more information on the data, please refer to the [github](https://github.com/johnhangen/2020_Election_Pipeline) about it.

## Structure

Each notebook follows a systematic approach:

1. **Initial Model Implementation:** We start by running each model with default hyperparameters to understand the basic behavior and performance.

2. **Validation Curves and Grid Search:** After the initial run, we employ validation curves and grid search techniques to fine-tune the hyperparameters.

3. **Final Modeling:** Using the optimized hyperparameters, we construct the final model for each algorithm.

## Highlights

* **High Accuracy:** Remarkably, all models achieved over 90% accuracy. This is particularly notable given the complexity of the dataset and the minimal preprocessing applied.

* **Complex Data Characteristics:** As illustrated in the data exploration notebook, the dataset displayed limited linear separability, adding to the challenge of the task.

* **Real-World Application:** The methods and analyses presented here go beyond academic exercises, offering insights applicable to real-world election data analysis.

## Future Directions

While this project mirrors an academic exercise, it stands as an independent analysis of the 2020 election data. In the future, I aspire to expand this work into a detailed report, delving deeper into the nuances of the dataset and the implications of the analysis. However, I do not want to get an AI report from school if the project closely mirrors work done for class.
